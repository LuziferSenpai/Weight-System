# Weight System

Hey Guys,

this Modification is in Alpha! So be careful with using it!

If you want Modded Items to be supported, send me via Forum a ZIP Package with the Data.
You can find everything what is needed in the `weights.lua` File.
I can add new Groups, but than pls send me a Tech Icon too.

If you need a List of missing Items with Weight Values just use the Command `/missing_weights`.

You can send me a locale File from your Language via Forum too.

Like the Modification Name says, its a Weight System for Factorio.
Each Item has a Weight Value and you move slower for more Weight in your Inventory/Quickbar/Trash Slots.
You can Increase the Maximum Weight you can hold via Tech, Armor, Exoskeleton Equipment or change the Settings in the Modsettings.

You can find the Supported Modifications in the `Supported.md` File.
